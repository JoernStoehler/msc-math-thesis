# Task Completion: Turing Dynamics Literature Deep Research

- Reformatted the deep-research report into structured Markdown with sections, tables, and numbered bibliography for ease of navigation.
- Preserved all substantive content from the 30-minute run while standardizing terminology and removing copy/paste artifacts.

## Suggested Follow-up
- Convert the annotated bibliography into a structured data source (e.g., CSV or Zotero collection) to enable cross-project citation reuse.
- Identify priority readings for near-term research sprintsâ€”consider focusing on Cotler & Rezchikov (2024) for simulation definitions and Huynh (2024) for explicit undecidable ODE examples.
- Evaluate whether any references provide reproducible code or datasets worth mirroring in the repository for experimentation.
