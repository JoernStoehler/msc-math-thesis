# Viterbo Conjecture

The Viterbo conjecture proposes a sharp relationship between symplectic capacity and volume for convex domains in symplectic Euclidean space. Roughly: among all convex domains with fixed volume, the Euclidean ball maximizes fundamental symplectic capacities. This connects symplectic topology with convex geometry and is closely related to symplectic isoperimetric-type inequalities.

## Motivation
- Clarify the landscape of symplectic capacities and their extremal properties.
- Understand known partial results, special cases, and related inequalities.
- Explore computational or experimental approaches on convex bodies to build intuition and test conjectural behaviors.

## Guiding Questions
- How do major capacities (Gromov width, Hofer–Zehnder, Ekeland–Hofer, ECH capacities) compare on convex domains?
- What is precisely stated by the Viterbo conjecture and for which classes is it known/unknown?
- What are the strongest known partial results and their methods (e.g., generating functions, symplectic embeddings, convex-geometric techniques)?
- Are there quantitative or computational experiments on specific convex families (ellipsoids, polydisks, Lp-balls) that illuminate the conjecture?

## Proposed Deliverables
- A concise but thorough survey of capacities and the Viterbo conjecture, with clear statements, examples, and a map of implications between results.
- Worked examples computing or bounding capacities for standard convex bodies.
- Optional: small computational notebooks exploring volume vs. capacity on parametric families of bodies.

## Preliminary Roadmap
Phase 1 — Foundations
1. Review symplectic manifolds, Hamiltonian dynamics, and symplectic embeddings; collect definitions of key capacities.
2. State the Viterbo conjecture precisely; assemble known equivalences and related conjectures.

Phase 2 — Known results and techniques
3. Study partial results and special cases, emphasizing proof strategies and tools (e.g., generating functions, ECH capacities, convex geometry links).
4. Compile examples (ellipsoids, polydisks, product bodies) with explicit bounds/values where available.

Phase 3 — Synthesis and exploration
5. Produce the survey write-up with diagrams and a results map.
6. (Optional) Implement computational experiments and discuss observations/heuristics.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Technical prerequisites: Allocate ramp-up time on capacities and embedding obstructions.
- Breadth vs. depth: Focus on a curated set of capacities and case studies to keep the project tractable.
