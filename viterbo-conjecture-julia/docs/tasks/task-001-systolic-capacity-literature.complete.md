# Task 001 — Follow-up Actions Completed

## Status
- ✅ Downloaded foundational papers on the systolic/symplectic capacity of convex bodies into `docs/literature/<slug>/main.pdf` for rapid onboarding.
- ✅ Drafted concise summaries for each paper in sibling `docs/literature/<slug>.summary.md` files to highlight relevance and computational takeaways for the Julia experiments.
- ✅ Replaced the placeholder Deep Research report with the formatted deliverable in `task-001-systolic-capacity-literature.report.md`, preserving the executive summary, bibliography, thematic analysis, open problems, and resource lists.

## Next Steps
- Expand the literature library with additional computational or code-oriented references (e.g., ECH capacity software, billiard-based algorithms) as they emerge from the annotated bibliography.
- Track future research updates—especially on symmetric cases, higher-capacity inequalities, and algorithmic tooling—and append addenda under `docs/tasks/task-001-systolic-capacity-literature.*` as new findings become available.
