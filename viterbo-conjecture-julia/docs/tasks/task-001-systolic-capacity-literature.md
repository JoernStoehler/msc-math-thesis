# Deep Research Prompt: Literature on Systolic Capacity of Convex Sets in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\)

You are ChatGPT with the Deep Research toolchain enabled. Run a comprehensive literature search and synthesis on results related to computing the systolic capacity of convex subsets \(P \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}\). The goal is to build a detailed reference file covering the full landscape of existing work, including classical sources, modern developments, computational advances, and notable partial results.

## Scope and Emphasis
- Focus on systolic capacities and closely related symplectic capacities (e.g., Ekeland–Hofer, Hofer–Zehnder, Gromov width) whenever they inform bounds or computations for convex bodies in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\).
- Include work on the Viterbo conjecture, Mahler-type inequalities, isoperimetric inequalities for symplectic capacities, and comparisons between different capacities.
- Capture both general theory and special cases (ellipsoids, polydisks, convex toric domains, smooth vs. non-smooth boundaries, high- vs low-dimensional instances).
- Highlight computational, algorithmic, or explicit formula approaches, even if heuristic or numerical.
- Document lemmas, inequalities, or reduction techniques that enable capacity computations or bounds.

## Search Strategy Guidance
- Use multiple search angles: “systolic capacity”, “Viterbo conjecture”, “symplectic capacity of convex bodies”, “Ekeland-Hofer capacity convex”, “Hofer-Zehnder convex”, “Gromov width convex body”, “symplectic Banach-Mazur distance”, “Mahler conjecture symplectic”, “toric domains symplectic capacity”.
- Look for survey papers, lecture notes, and monographs that collect known capacity computations.
- Track influential authors (e.g., Viterbo, Artstein-Avidan, Ostrover, Hofer, Zehnder, Cieliebak, Seyfaddini, Gutkin, Schlenk, Frauenfelder, Abbondandolo, Haim-Kislev, Kawakami, Kim, and others working on convex symplectic geometry).
- Include relevant arXiv preprints, journal articles, theses, and conference proceedings.

## Deliverables
Produce a report that contains:
1. **Executive summary** of the state of the art, including the best known bounds for the systolic capacity on convex subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\) and status of the Viterbo conjecture.
2. **Annotated bibliography**: for each work, list
   - Full citation (authors, year, title, venue or arXiv identifier).
   - Scope (dimension, type of convex body, special assumptions).
   - Main results relevant to systolic capacity or related invariants.
   - Techniques used (e.g., symplectic embedding constructions, generating functions, Floer theory, billiard dynamics, convex analysis, computational methods).
   - Explicit formulas, inequalities, or algorithms provided, with notes on how to apply them to compute or bound capacities.
   - Connections to other works in the bibliography.
3. **Thematic organization** highlighting clusters such as general theory, explicit computations, computational/numerical methods, toric or lattice-symmetric examples, Mahler-type inequalities, and related conjectures.
4. **Open problems and gaps** identified in the literature, particularly computational or dimension-specific challenges.
5. **Dataset suggestions**: any publicly available code, tables, or appendices with computed capacities that could be digitized or reused.

## Quality Expectations
- Provide as extensive a list as possible (dozens of entries if available), prioritizing relevance but erring on the side of inclusion.
- Use precise mathematical language and include short quotations or equation references when they clarify the contribution.
- Distinguish between rigorous results and conjectural or numerical evidence.
- Cross-reference items to show how results build on each other.
