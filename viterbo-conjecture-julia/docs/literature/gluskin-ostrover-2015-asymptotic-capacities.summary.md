# Asymptotic behavior of symplectic capacities of convex bodies (Gluskin–Ostrover, 2015)

- **Bibliographic info:** E. D. Gluskin, Y. Ostrover, *Selecta Math. (N.S.)* 21 (2015), 509–529. Preprint `arXiv:1207.5146`.
- **Focus:** Studies the growth of symplectic capacities—including the Viterbo capacity—for high-dimensional convex bodies and compares them with volume asymptotics.
- **Key results:** Shows that the ratios \(c(K)^n/\operatorname{vol}(K)\) for random centrally-symmetric convex bodies concentrate near the conjectured optimum up to logarithmic factors; derives upper bounds via concentration of measure.
- **Techniques:** Applies probabilistic convex geometry (Dvoretzky theorem, Milman-type estimates) to control support functions and symplectic images in high dimension.
- **Relevance:** Provides quantitative evidence supporting Viterbo’s conjecture in the asymptotic regime and motivates numerical experiments on random convex bodies.
