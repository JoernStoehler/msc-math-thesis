# Metric isoperimetric inequalities in symplectic geometry (Viterbo, 2000)

- **Bibliographic info:** C. Viterbo, *J. Differential Geom.* 59 (2001), 627–662. Preprint available as `arXiv:math/9903172`.
- **Focus:** Introduces the symplectic capacity now called the Viterbo or symplectic systolic capacity for smooth convex bodies in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\), aiming to relate it to Euclidean volume via an isoperimetric-type inequality.
- **Key results:** Formulates the Viterbo conjecture \(\frac{c(K)^n}{\operatorname{vol}(K)} \leq \frac{c(B)^{n}}{\operatorname{vol}(B)}\) with equality for symplectic balls, proves it for ellipsoids and certain symmetric convex bodies, and establishes comparison bounds with Ekeland–Hofer capacities.
- **Techniques:** Uses generating function methods and action selectors to define the capacity for convex sets, together with symplectic homogenization to derive upper bounds.
- **Relevance:** Provides the foundational definition and conjectural sharp inequality driving most later work on systolic capacities of convex domains.
