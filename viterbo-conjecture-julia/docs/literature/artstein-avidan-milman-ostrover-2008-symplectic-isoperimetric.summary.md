# The Symplectic Isoperimetric Conjecture (Artstein-Avidan–Milman–Ostrover, 2008)

- **Bibliographic info:** S. Artstein-Avidan, V. D. Milman, Y. Ostrover, *J. Amer. Math. Soc.* 21 (2008), 121–138. Preprint `arXiv:math/0610150`.
- **Focus:** Establishes equivalences between Viterbo's conjectured volume–capacity inequality for convex domains and sharp forms of the Mahler conjecture, bridging symplectic and asymptotic geometric analysis.
- **Key results:** Shows that verifying the conjectured inequality for centrally symmetric convex bodies implies the long-standing Mahler conjecture; provides upper bounds for symplectic capacities via mean width and convex-geometric functionals.
- **Techniques:** Employs symplectic reduction, contact transformations, and dual mixed volumes to transport convex-geometric inequalities into symplectic capacity estimates.
- **Relevance:** Identifies deep links between symplectic systolic capacity problems and convex geometry, suggesting strategies that combine both toolkits for convex subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\).
