# From symplectic measurements to the Mahler conjecture (Artstein-Avidan–Karasev–Ostrover, 2014)

- **Bibliographic info:** S. Artstein-Avidan, R. Karasev, Y. Ostrover, *Duke Math. J.* 163 (2014), 2003–2022. Preprint `arXiv:1206.1830`.
- **Focus:** Develops symplectic capacities defined via convex-geometric data and derives new inequalities connecting symplectic volume products with Mahler-type invariants.
- **Key results:** Proves that sharp symplectic systolic inequalities would imply Mahler's conjecture for centrally symmetric bodies, and establishes near-optimal bounds for several families (e.g., zonoids, Hanner polytopes).
- **Techniques:** Combines symplectic reduction, Legendre transforms of support functions, and mixed-volume estimates with generating function capacities.
- **Relevance:** Supplies a toolbox for computing or bounding systolic capacities of specific convex bodies through explicit convex-geometric transforms, guiding algorithmic experimentation.
