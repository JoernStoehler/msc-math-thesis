- **Bibliographic info:** A. Akopyan, R. N. Karasev, A. A. Petrov, *Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.* 370 (2018), 8097–8117. Preprint `arXiv:1209.1142`.
- **Focus:** Investigates symplectic capacities of convex bodies via billiard trajectories and develops combinatorial-geometric methods to approach Viterbo-type inequalities.
- **Key results:** Establishes sharp bounds for the symplectic capacity of Hanner polytopes and certain Lagrangian product domains; relates minimal billiard trajectories to systolic capacity computations.
- **Techniques:** Utilizes symplectic billiards, discrete geometry, and Mahler volume inequalities to derive explicit capacity estimates.
- **Relevance:** Supplies constructive methods that can be implemented algorithmically to approximate systolic capacities for specific convex polytopes, informing computational experiments in the Julia project.
